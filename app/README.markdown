Thank you for your time and consideration of my submission. In the requested time allotted, I was unable to fulfill the Dynamic Content portion of the challenge, although I did attempt to complete it.

# Code Challenge Notes

Utilized jQuery for on click functionality and toggle fold function for the transition
between baby steps.

Attempted to match the mockups, did not utilize the shadow images in order to meet the 
requested timeframe.

The AJAX call would have pulled the data from the JSON file and looped through to obtain the names of the individuals with the associated baby step and sort by alphabetical order. I would then use a switch case to determine which `<p>` would be added to the webpage.

Also, if more time was available I would attempt to make the JS code dry.
