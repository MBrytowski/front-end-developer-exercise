                <p>An emergency fund is for those unexpected events in life that you can’t plan for: the loss of a job,
                    an
                    unexpected pregnancy, a faulty car transmission, and the list goes on and on. It’s not a matter of
                    if these
                    events will happen; it’s simply a matter of when they will happen.</p>

                <p>This beginning emergency fund will keep life’s little Murphies from turning into new debt while you
                    work off
                    the
                    old debt. If a real emergency happens, you can handle it with your emergency fund. No more
                    borrowing. It’s
                    time
                    to break the cycle of debt!</p>

                <img src="assets/images/headings/heading_bs2.png" alt="">

                <p>List your debts, excluding the house, in order. The smallest balance should be your number one
                    priority.
                    Don’t
                    worry about interest rates unless two debts have similar payoffs. If that’s the case, then list the
                    higher
                    interest rate debt first.</p>

                <p>The point of the debt snowball is simply this: You need some quick wins in order to stay pumped up
                    about
                    getting
                    out of debt! Paying off debt is not always about math. It’s about motivation. Personal finance is
                    20%
                    head
                    knowledge and 80% behavior. When you start knocking off the easier debts, you will see results and
                    you
                    will
                    stay
                    motivated to dump your debt.</p>

                <p>Once you complete the first two baby steps, you will have built serious momentum. But don’t start
                    throwing
                    all
                    your “extra” money into investments quite yet. It’s time to build your full emergency fund. Ask
                    yourself,
                    “What
                    would it take for me to live for three to six months if I lost my income?” Your answer to that
                    question
                    is
                    how
                    much you should save.</p>

                <p>Use this money for emergencies only: incidents that would have a major impact on you and your family.
                    Keep
                    these
                    savings in a money market account. Remember, this stash of money is not an investment; it is
                    insurance
                    you’re
                    paying to yourself, a buffer between you and life.</p>

                <img src="assets/images/headings/heading_bs4.png" alt="">

                <p>When you reach this step, you’ll have no payments—except the house—and a fully funded emergency fund.
                    Now
                    it’s
                    time to get serious about building wealth.</p>

                <p>Dave suggests investing 15% of your household income into Roth IRAs and pre-tax retirement plans.
                    Don’t
                    invest
                    more than that because the extra money will help you complete the next two steps: college savings
                    and
                    paying
                    off
                    your home early.</p>

                <div id="message"></div>

            </div>

            <div class="babyStep5">
                <img src="assets/images/headings/heading_bs5.png" alt="">

                <p>By this point, you should have already started Baby Step 4—investing 15% of your income—before saving
                    for
                    college. Whether you are saving for you or your child to go to college, you need to start now.</p>

                <p>In order to have enough money saved for college, you need to have a goal. Determine how much per
                    month
                    you
                    should be saving at 12% interest in order to have enough for college. If you save at 12% and
                    inflation
                    is at
                    4%,
                    then you are moving ahead of inflation at a net of 8% per year!</p>

                <img src="assets/images/headings/heading_bs6.png" alt="">

                <p>Now it’s time to begin chunking all of your extra money toward the mortgage. You are getting closer
                    to
                    realizing
                    the dream of a life with no house payments.</p>

                <p>As you attack this last debt, you will gain momentum much like you did back in the second step of the
                    debt
                    snowball. Remember, having absolutely no payments is totally within your reach!</p>

            <div class="babyStep7">
                <img src="assets/images/headings/heading_bs7.png" alt="">

                <p>It’s time to build wealth and give like never before. Leave an inheritance for future generations,
                    and
                    bless
                    others now with your excess. It's really the only way to live!</p>

                <p>Golda Meir says, “You can’t shake hands with a clenched fist.” Vow to never hold your money so
                    tightly
                    that
                    you
                    never give any away. Hoarding money is not the way to wealth. Save for yourself, save for your
                    family’s
                    future,
                    and be gracious enough to bless others. You can do all three at the same time.</p>
